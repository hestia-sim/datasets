# Description
This scenario is centered on just one room in the house, where three residents have distinct routines and specific preferences when using the devices in the living room, which is the main living space. The living room is equipped with a TV, air conditioning, lamps and a sound system, and each resident interacts with these devices in a personalized way. Resident A prefers to watch TV with the volume up and the room well lit, adjusting the light intensity and keeping the air conditioning at a lower temperature for his comfort. He alternates between watching TV and leaving the room briefly, with long periods of absence during the day. Resident B prefers a more moderate environment, keeping the air conditioning at a higher temperature and using automatic mode. He usually watches TV at a low volume and, at certain times, turns the TV off to listen to music at moderate volumes, adjusting the lights and the climate to create a relaxed environment. Resident C, in turn, prefers a more intense style of interaction with the devices. He keeps the air conditioning on "wind" mode and uses high volumes on both the TV and the sound system. Their routine includes watching TV, studying and taking short breaks outside the living room, but their preference for loud volumes is a defining characteristic. Each resident adjusts the living room environment according to their preferences, reflecting their individual habits and tastes.
