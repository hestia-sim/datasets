# Description
In this scenario, two residents share an apartment with six rooms, using various devices. The first resident's routine is centered on using the computer, both for work and leisure. He starts the day by waking up in Room 01, continues with activities in the bathroom and having breakfast, and then works outside the house, returning for lunch and then leaving again for work. In the evening, he performs his hygiene activities, has dinner and gets ready for bed. The second resident divides his time between listening to music, using the computer for work \textit{from office} and doing household chores. His routine begins in Room 02, followed by using the bathroom and having breakfast. Throughout the day, he alternates between using the computer in the living room and in the bedroom, listening to music at specific times and doing tasks such as washing clothes and cooking. On weekends, he usually goes out for long periods of time for walks.
